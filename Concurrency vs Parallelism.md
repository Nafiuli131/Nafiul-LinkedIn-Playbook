Concurrency vs Parallelism – A Kitchen Story 🍳



Yesterday, I walked into a busy restaurant and watched the magic happen in the kitchen. 👀



There was one chef, juggling multiple orders. While waiting for the soup to simmer, he chopped vegetables for another dish. Then he stirred the sauce, checked the grill, and somehow, all the orders kept moving forward.



That’s concurrency — handling many tasks at once, but not exactly at the same time. Think of it like a single-core CPU switching between tasks rapidly. ⏳



Next, I noticed three chefs working together, each on a different dish. One grilled, one boiled, one plated. The dishes were ready almost simultaneously.



That’s parallelism — multiple tasks happening at the exact same moment. Just like a multi-core CPU executing tasks truly in parallel. ⚡



💡 In programming:

Concurrency = efficient task handling (single-core style)

Parallelism = tasks executing simultaneously (multi-core style)



So next time your backend handles hundreds of requests or crunches big data, think of that kitchen 👨‍🍳 — a little orchestration, a little speed everything runs smoothly. ✨😌
